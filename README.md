## Key Concepts

### React Functional Components
- The application is built using functional components such as `Header`, `ContactList`, `AddContact`, `EditContact`, `ContactDetail`, and `ConfirmationDialog`.

### React Hooks
- **useState**: Used for managing state in functional components.
- **useEffect**: Used for performing side effects in functional components.
- **useRef**: Used for accessing DOM elements directly.

### React Router
- **BrowserRouter**: Used for routing in the application.
- **Routes** and **Route**: Used for defining routes in the application.
- **useNavigate**: Used for programmatically navigating between routes.
- **useLocation**: Used for accessing the current location object.

### UUID
- **uuidv4**: Used for generating unique IDs for contacts.

### Semantic UI
- Used for styling the application with pre-built CSS classes.

### JSON Server
- Used for simulating a REST API to manage contacts.

### Local Storage
- Used for persisting contacts data in the browser's local storage.
